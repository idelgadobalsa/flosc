Based on the original bridge developed by Ben Chun that you can find at http://www.benchun.net/flosc/ and the AS Classes from Fwiidom.org by [Adam Robertson](http://www.dustypixels.com)

An AS3 library that communicates with a "Flosc server" to enable flash apps to get OSC information

If you are looking for **Tuio** communication then apart from this library you'll need the [tuio-as3-lib](http://code.google.com/p/tuio-as3-lib)

## For mac users: ##

  * Use [Oscar](http://www.todo.to.it/blog/oscar/) for an UDP-to-XML
  * Use [memo.tv udp-tcp-bridge](http://code.google.com/p/udp-tcp-bridge/) for a binary socket instead
